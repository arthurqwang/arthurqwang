# About me

## Arthur Q. W.
### ☑️ As the Founder of Thought of Big Systems View
Based on traditional systems theory and systems engineering ideas, combined with our own long-term and rich experience in information and digital construction, we propose a new concept of large-scale systems, which mainly includes system structure dynamics, holographic organic system theory, large-scale system philosophy and methodology, and apply it to the fields of digital/intelligent oil fields and AI development applications.
